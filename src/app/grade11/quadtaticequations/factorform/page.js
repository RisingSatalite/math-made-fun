            Quadratic equations


            <p>the factored form of a quadratic equation is</p>
            <p>y = A ( X - R ) ( X - S )</p>

            <p>If a is positive the graph goes up, but if negative, it trend down</p>
            <p>X interept are when X is equal to eithor R or R</p>
            <p>Y intercept is when X = 0, replace X with 0 and solve the equations</p>
            <p>Vertex is the point where the graph reaches its maximum or minimum value</p>
            <p>The coorindates of the vertex uses the points (H,K)</p>
            <p>To get vertex, use the formula H = (R + S)/2</p>
            <p>To get the value K, replace X with the value H and solve for Y</p>

            <p>To convert the factored form to standard from, simple multiple the factored form</p>
