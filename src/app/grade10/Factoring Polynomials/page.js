      <p>Factoring polynomials can look diffuclt, but after facotring, it can be reveal that are mostly simple smaller equations combined.</p>
      <p>Simplify first, if all terms can be divided by something, such a number or vairble, you should so that it is simpler when you need to factor</p>
      <p>Exmaple, you can pull a 2 out of 2x^2+4x+16 to get 2*(x^2+2x+8)</p>
