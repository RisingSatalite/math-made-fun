      <p>A Vectors is a physical quantity that possesses an inherit "magnitude" and "direction"</p>
      <p>Vectors do not care about directions</p>
      <p>Insert example with multiple arrows poiting in sma edirection</p>
      <p>While all of these vetocr are at different locations, they are the same vector, because the same magnitude and direction</p>
      <p>If you move a veoctr it is still the same vector</p>
      <p>But rotation, scaling and fliping all change magnitidut and or direction and therfore make a new vector</p>
      <p>For smiplicity and standarisation, we draw the vecotr starting from the origin, so taht we do not care about location.</p>
      <p>Now that we are drawing the vector from the origin, 1 unique vector connect to every points, which mean that every vector has a corrosponding point</p>
      <p>Therefore, vectors and points are the same mathematic object.</p>
      draw a line connecting with a random point of a different colour
      <p>We can write vector with the point info</p>
      <p>P=(a,b) V=[A,B]T ∈ <b>ℝ</b></p>
      <p>As we get more demision with points, vector become longer</p>
      <p>P=(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub> ... n<sub>n</sub>) V=[n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub> ... n<sub>n</sub>]<sup>T</sup> ∈ ℝ</p>
